  title: Telzio Webhooks API
  version: v3
  description: |
    ## General
    When configuring your webhook you have two choices of format: `JSON` or `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

    The consuming API has 15 seconds to accept the event. If a success http status code has not been returned with these 15 seconds, the event will be discarded and the engine will proceed to the next one.

    Only one event is dispatched at a time, and in sequence. There is no parallel dispatch against a single customer end point, and the engine will not try to resend a failed request.

    If a consuming API consistently fails over a period of time, the engine will suspend delivery until the customer manually re-enables distribution of events.

    The Telzio webhook supports authenticating against the customer API using either a, by the customer specified, Bearer Token or Basic Authentication. In both cases the customer enters either the token or credentials for basic auth on the Telzio website.

    ## Authentication
    In case of Bearer token authentication, the engine will issue all HTTP Requests with the following Header: `Authorization: Bearer`

    In case of Basic Authentication it will be as follows: `Authorization: Basic`
